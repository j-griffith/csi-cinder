# csi-cinder
CSI driver implementation for OpenStack Cinder

Right now this is basically just more or less notes and 
a place to capture ideas/direction.  Want to flush out 
the CSI requests/responses and start implementing against
gophercloud Cinder endpoint.

This won't compile, is missing CSI function implementation
and is mostly worthless except to me as a work area.

The utils file is strictly for example right now.
